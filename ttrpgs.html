                    <h3>what are ttrpgs?</h3>
                    <p>ttrpgs, or tabletop role playing games, are a form of collaborative storytelling.
                        if you've heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons" target="_blank">D&D</a>, 
                        that's one of the most popular ttrpgs! i don't play it though. too many numbers. 
                        i play games like <a href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/" target="_blank">Monster of the Week </a> 
                        and <a href="https://magpiegames.com/masks/" target="_blank">Masks</a> with a regular playgroup, 
                        as well as in quarterly campaigns run by the tabletop club at my school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        most of my art in the last year or two has been inspired by the tabletop games that i play in.
                        it's fun to play as a character, and then get to draw them and the situations they get into 
                        as a way of visualizing the story i'm telling with my friends.

                        <ul class="keywords">
                            <li><em>campaign:</em> a long-running story told in several parts</li>
                            <li><em>session:</em> a single part of a campaign, usually a 3-4 hour event
                                where we roll dice, eat snacks, and talk a whole lot</li>
                            <li><em>PC:</em> player character, a character in the story played by one of the players</li>
                            <li><em>NPC:</em> non-player character, a character played by the GM</li>
                            <li><em>GM:</em> game master. it tends to be called something different in every system, 
                            but it's the person who runs the story and creates the world that the PCs exist in</li>
                            <li><em>system:</em> the game that's being played. the set of rules and structure 
                                you follow as you tell your story. sorta like a framework for your storytelling. examples include

                <h2>&#x2B50; STARLESS &#x2B50;<i>(fall 2019)</i></h2>
                <p>
                    starless was my first campaign. It was in the Monster of the Week system.
                    it was a great campaign! i played as <em>Riley Vandergaard</em> <i>(they/them)</i>, using the Mundane playbook.
                    they're a average 20 yr old in a third rim suburb of Detroit. they play hockey, 
                    work at a coffee shop and an ACE Hardware, and bike to community college classes 
                    in the next town over. oh, and fight monsters, of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    also featured in a lot of the Riley art is Leah <i>(she/her)</i>, Riley's high school crush and the sole member of 
                    their high school hockey team to go professional. they had quite the rivalry back in high school, 
                    but now that they're graduated, Riley's trying to work up the courage to ask Leah out. (it works)

                <h2>&#x1F30C; DREAMSCAPE &#x1F30C;<i>(summer 2021 - present)</i></h2>
                <p>
                    dreamscape was the first time i played a campaign with my current playgroup outside of the 
                    tabletop club. it's an ongoing campaign (as of June 2021), and it's also in the Monster of the 
                    Week system. my character is <em>Aster Chung</em> <i>(they/them)</i>, using the Searcher playbook. they're a grad student 
                    studying astrophysics at Northwestern University and, at the beginning of the story, looking for 
                    their missing twin sister who fell into a mysterious portal when they were 13 or so. since then, they've 
                    fallen into a number of portals themselves, but always managed to find their way back home. 
                    they managed to stumble across a pair of vampires on the train once, and things haven't been the 
                    same since. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aster is joined in their monster hunting adventures by the other two PCs, Alan 
                    and Amy, as well as a cast of NPCs, like 
                    their partner and roommate, Ashe, 
                    a resident of the secret magical district of Chicago, Gary, and 
                    Alan's mysterious aunt, Karina, who's an author by day and an arcane researcher by night. 
                    also featured are Andie, Aster's returned twin, and 
                    Rachel, Aster's closest friend (and eventually Andie's partner).

                <h2>&#x1F320; SKY HIGH &#x1F320; <i>(summer 2021 - present)</i></h2>
                <p>
                    sky high (as we jokingly and lovingly refer to it) was the second campaign for our playgroup. 
                    it's also still ongoing (as of June 2021). 
                    it uses the Masks system, which is all about teen superheroes and their emotions. my character 
                    is <em>Taika Nguyen</em> <i>(she/her)</i> (aka Runestar), who is the Scion. her playbook is all 
                    about respect and trust, as she's the daughter of the most powerful villain in the city. 
                    their name is Fabian (aka Runesmith) and they love their daughter dearly, but sometimes their 
                    need to never be boring can be a tad worrisome for her. Taika has magical knowledge, allowing
                    her to fight with spells in the form of circular runes drawn in the air or a mimicry spell that is 
                    tattooed on her shoulder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    besides her parent, Fabian, there a couple of other important people in her life. her team consists
                    of the PCs, Ezra, Vicente, and Luxin. she has a sibling, Tess, who's also a villain, though it's mostly just
                    to hang out with their crush. she spars with Rhea, another young hero, on the weekends as a way to 
                    get better at being a hero, but also because she thinks Rhea is cute. her dad, David, went missing a few
                    years back, but when he was still around, the family would all bake bread together and sell it at 
                    the farmer's market. now that's mostly just Fabian's job.

                <p>
                    world tour was a campaign i was in through the tabletop club. it was an experimental design for 
                    a campaign, taking place in a different system every session. i played as <em>Cass Jimenez</em> 
                    <i>(she/her)</i>, carpenter, loving wife to Claire, and monster hunter extraordinare, who got 
                    sucked into a portal that took her from dimension to dimension, along with the rest of her team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the systems we played in were Monster of the Week, Casket Land, Masks, Dungeon World, 
                    Alas for the Awful Sea, Action Movie World, and Urban Shadows, which all use the 
                    Powered by the Apocalypse framework.

                    children of beneath was another campaign i played in through the tabletop club in the Monster 
                    of the Week system. i played a Hex, <em>Briar May</em> <i>(they/them)</i>. Briar is a 
                    mischevious witch who likes to drink tea, collect debris in mason jars, and set things on fire.

                    phoenix academy was another tabletop club campaign that i played in. it was in the Masks system, 
                    and i played as <em>Fig Polaski</em> <i>(she/they)</i> (aka Persephone), a Nova. her story is all 
                    about power, as the Nova playbook is about a hero with more power than they know what to do with, 
                    and it can get uncontrollable at times. Fig has biokinesis, which for her, means she can grow and ungrow
                    plants, as well as influence the energy and lifeforce of humans.
